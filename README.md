## Introduction
With increasing security concerns in public spaces, this project aims to develop an automated weapon detection system using real-time CCTV footage. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning, the system identifies weapons and alerts authorities to potential threats in real-time.

---

## Problem Statement
Surveillance systems often lack the capability for real-time weapon detection. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and prone to human error, which calls for an automated system capable of addressing:
1. The identification of weapons in crowded environments.
2. Minimization of false positives and negatives in detection.

---

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system uses the **YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once)** algorithm for real-time object detection and classification. Key features of the system:
- Binary classification: **Pistol** and **Not-Pistol**.
- Training on a custom-built dataset.
- Real-time alert mechanism for detected threats.

### Architecture
The system follows a pipeline consisting of:
1. **Data Collection & Annotation**: Collection of weapon images from various sources and annotation using bounding boxes.
2. **Model Training**: YOLOv4 model trained using transfer learning.
3. **Real-Time Detection**: Integration with CCTV systems for real-time analysis.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Model**: YOLOv4
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset
The dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including:
- Online repositories
- CCTV footage from YouTube
- Internet Movie Firearms Database (IMFDB)
- Public datasets like ImageNet

### Classes:
1. **Pistol**: Includes images of pistols and revolvers.
2. **Not-Pistol**: Includes objects like mobile phones, wallets, and metal detectors to reduce false positives.

Data preprocessing involved resizing, normalization, and data augmentation for better model performance.

## Implementation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/weapon-detection-cctv.git
   cd weapon-detection-cctv
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model:
bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py --config config/yolov4.cfg --data data/dataset.yaml
Test the model on live footage:
bash
Copy
Edit
python detect.py --video path/to/video.mp4
Results
The trained YOLOv4 model achieved:

Detection Accuracy: 95%
Real-Time Processing Speed: 45 FPS
The system successfully identified weapons in live CCTV footage and displayed bounding boxes around detected objects.

Future Scope
Enhanced Accuracy: Integrate more advanced models like YOLOv5 or transformer-based models.
Multi-Class Detection: Expand the dataset to include other weapons like knives and rifles.
Integration with Law Enforcement Systems: Automatic reporting to authorities in case of detection.
Mobile Integration: Develop a mobile app to provide instant alerts.

## Introduction

The increasing crime rate in public spaces has made security a critical concern. Surveillance cameras are widely used for monitoring purposes but lack the ability to detect potential threats in real-time automatically. This project develops an automated weapon detection system using **YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once)**, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. 

The system is designed to identify weapons such as pistols in real-time CCTV footage, providing instant alerts to security personnel and law enforcement agencies. By automating this process, the system reduces human error and improves response times in critical situations.

---

## Problem Statement

Manual monitoring of CCTV footage is prone to human error, time-consuming, and often inefficient in identifying potential threats. The primary challenges include:
- Detecting weapons in crowded or low-visibility conditions.
- Reducing false positives and false negatives in weapon identification.
- Providing real-time alerts to prevent crimes.

---

## Objective

The project aims to develop a robust and efficient real-time weapon detection system that:
1. Automatically detects weapons in CCTV footage using deep learning algorithms.
2. Alerts security personnel in real-time upon detection of a weapon.
3. Reduces manual effort and human error in surveillance.

---

## Proposed Solution

The system utilizes the **YOLOv4 algorithm** to achieve high-speed and accurate weapon detection. Key components include:
- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishes between "Pistol" and "Not-Pistol" categories.
- **Custom Dataset**: Built from multiple sources to train the model for real-world scenarios.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Processes live CCTV footage and triggers alerts when a weapon is detected.

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a structured pipeline:
1. **Data Collection and Annotation**:
   - Images of pistols, revolvers, and non-weapon objects (e.g., wallets, phones).
   - Annotation using bounding boxes for supervised learning.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Pre-trained YOLOv4 model fine-tuned with the custom dataset.
   - Hyperparameter optimization for improved accuracy.

3. **Real-Time Detection**:
   - Integration with live CCTV footage.
   - Bounding boxes around detected weapons with classification labels.

4. **Alert Mechanism**:
   - Triggers alerts to notify security personnel of potential threats.
